- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jefry1217
- 👀 I’m interested in basically just solving problems. I love computer science because I love technology and I love the challenge of working on new projects, learning things, and trying to solve difficult problems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can to do with programming, over the uni holidays I'm gonna be focused on learning algorithms and maybe making some useful programs in my free time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically any projects that I can work on, if it's something that I can learn from, then let's do it.
- 📫 How to reach me (i'll update this later).
