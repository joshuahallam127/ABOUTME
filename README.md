- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jefry1217
- 👀 I'm interested in all things technology and innovation, and love solving problems. I love the challenge of working on new projects, learning things, and trying to come up with unique solutions to difficult problems that will help increase people's quality of life and/or advance human civilization.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning anything I can to do with programming, however I'm specifically interested in software and data structures and algorithms right now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will challenge me, if it's something that I can learn from, then let's do it.
